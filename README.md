# Data-Structures

This repository contains all of my previous COSC 2436: Programming and Data Structures homework, labs, and group projects. All of the assignment prompts and solutions are included in their respective directories. There are files that deal with ArgumentManager and its components. This was used by the professor of the course to grade the assignments in a more automated fashion, because of this, these files can be ignored as they do not affect the solution to the code. There are also test files along with their respective solutions in the form of .txt files.
